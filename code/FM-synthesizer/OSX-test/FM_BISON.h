	Syntherklaas FM presents 'FM. BISON'
	(C) syntherklaas.org, a subsidiary of visualizers.nl

	This is intended to be a powerful yet relatively simple FM synthesizer core.

	I have to thank the following people for helping me with their knowledge, ideas and experience:
		- Pieter v/d Meer
		- Ronny Pries (Ronny Pries/Farbrausch)
		- Tammo Hinrichs (KB/Farbarausch)
		- Alex Bartholomeus (Deadline/Superstition)
		- Thorsten Ørts (Thorsten/Purple)
		- Stijn Haring-Kuipers
		- Zden Hlinka (Zden/Satori)

	Notes:
	
	It's intended to be portable to embedded platforms in plain C if required (which it isn't now but close enough for an easy port), 
	and in part supplemented by hardware components if that so happens to be a good idea.
	
	So the style will look a bit dated here and there.

	Priority / Bugs:
		- Finish up ADSR (see impl.)
		- Implement a master rotary or fader to scale voice amplitude ("main")	
		- Smooth out MIDI controls using Maarten van Strien's trick (interpolate 64 samples until next value)
		- Use ring buffer to feed

	To do:
		- Take another gander at oscillators (clean ones)
		- Implement LFOs: form, period, frequency, aplitude, and apply it to modulation index first
		- Impement pitch bend
		- For now it is convenient to keep modulators and carriers apart but they might start sharing too much logic
		  to keep it this way.
		- Optimization, FIXMEs, interpolation, keeping tracking NAN bugs.
		- See notebook.
